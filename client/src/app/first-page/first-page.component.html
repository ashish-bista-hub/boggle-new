      The game begins by shaking a covered tray of 16 cubic dice, each with a different letter printed on each of its sides.
      The dice settle into a 4Ã—4 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible.
      After they have settled into the grid, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players
      simultaneously begin the main phase of play. For more Info visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Wikipedia</a>
